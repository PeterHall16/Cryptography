# Cryptography
Several python programs for the old-fashioned type of cryptography and ciphers.
- Programmed in Python 3.6.5
- Uses Numpy (http://www.numpy.org/) and Colorama (https://github.com/tartley/colorama) libraries.
- Encryption on affine.py works only if the dimensions of the key matrix is a factor of the length of the phrase to be encrypted. Decryption not yet functional.
- Vigenere still has some glitches as of 7/16/2018 (M/D/Y)
